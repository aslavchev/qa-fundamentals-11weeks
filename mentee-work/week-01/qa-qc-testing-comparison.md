# QA vs QC vs Testing

## Part A: Comparison Chart

| Aspect | QA (Quality Assurance) | QC (Quality Control) | Testing |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Definition | A process focused on **preventing defects** in the processes that create the product. | A process focused on **detecting and correcting defects** in the finished product. | An activity aimed at **identifying errors or inconsistencies** in the product through test execution. |
| Focus | The processes and systems that lead to a quality product. | The final products and their characteristics. | Specific functionalities or components of the product. |
| Approach | Proactive (preventing defects). | Reactive (detecting defects). | Executing test cases to verify functionality. |
| Timing | During development / throughout the entire product lifecycle. | After development, before or during release. | After building functionalities or components (unit, integration, system testing). |
| Responsibility | The entire quality and process management team. | QC team or testers, sometimes QA specialists. | Testers or QA specialists executing the tests. |
| Example Activity | - Defining standards and processes<br>- Conducting process audits<br>- Training the team on best practices | - Code reviews<br>- Documentation inspection<br>- Verifying implemented features against specifications | - Unit tests<br>- Integration tests<br>- UI/UX tests<br>- Regression tests |

## Part B: Real-World Examples

### QA Examples
1. Creating coding standards and establishing a team-wide code review process.
2. Conducting a process audit to ensure Agile/Scrum practices are being followed.
3. Organizing a security and best development practices training session.

### QC Examples
1. Reviewing technical documentation for errors or missing information.
2. Visually checking the website interface against design mockups.
3. Inspecting the final product to ensure features work correctly before release.

### Testing Examples
1. Performing unit tests for individual functions.
2. Conducting integration tests to verify interactions between modules.
3. Running regression tests after updates to ensure no existing functionality is broken.

## Part C: Scenario Classification

1. Executing test cases for the login feature → **Testing**
2. Establishing coding standards for the development team → **QA**
3. Conducting code reviews before merging pull requests → **QC**
4. Running automated regression tests → **Testing**
5. Creating a deployment process checklist → **QA**
6. Reporting a bug found during test execution → **QC**
7. Implementing a peer review process → **QA**
8. Validating that requirements are testable → **QA**
