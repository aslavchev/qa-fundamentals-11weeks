### Compatibility Matrix

| Browser / Device | Login | Product Catalog | Shopping Cart | Checkout | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|----------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Chrome Desktop  |Seems the same as Safari Desktop.|
| Safari Desktop  |All things tested until now are on Safari Desktop, so all previous findings apply here.|
| Chrome Mobile   |  Login OK     |Images of products are stretched, also there are big gaps between description and price. When user opens the product, the picture is too big and takes up the whole screen so they have to scroll.|Shopping cart requires horizontal scrolling.|Checkout page is not fitting into the screen, the user has to unzoom to see it fully, just like in Product Catalog page.|Overall things do not look good on mobile, it is not suited well enough so it is hard to navigate. Also the same issue is present in the Shopping Cart about not being able to add more than one of a product.|
| Safari Mobile   |  Login OK     |Images of products are stretched, also there are big gaps between description and price. When user opens the product, the picture is too big and takes up the whole screen so they have to scroll.|Shopping cart seems to be working fine.|Checkout page is not fitting into the screen, the user has to unzoom to see it fully, just like in Product Catalog page.|A bit better than on Chrome mobile, but still not suited.|
